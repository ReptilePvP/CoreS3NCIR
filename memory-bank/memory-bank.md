- Hardware button navigation (no touch input)
- NCIR temperature sensor integration
- Persistent settings storage
- Audio alerts and visual indicators

## Current Project State
- Basic multi-screen UI implemented with LVGL
- MLX90614 sensor integration working
- Hardware interrupt-based button handling
